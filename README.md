# Crazy Eights

## Introduction

While playing cards, I had the idea to program Crazy Eights because it seemed like a fun project. Initially, I wanted to write it in Java, but since I'm learning Rust I decided to challenge myself.
I plan to write documentation of the program's design before coding it. This should help me make better choices ahead of time and I will be able to explore different implementations in Rust before deciding how to implement the design.

## Future Plans

I will be testing the game's functions against the requirements of the game and then I will write networking code for the game to enable multiplayer functionality.

I will also refactor the code structure to include a `lib.rs` for all of the actual functionality. After reading more from the Rust Book, I plan to only use `main.rs` to pass command-line args and setup the rest of the program.
