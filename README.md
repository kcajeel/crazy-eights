# Crazy Eights

## Introduction

While playing cards, I had the idea to program Crazy Eights because it seemed like a fun project. Initially, I wanted to write it in Java, but since I'm learning Rust I decided to challenge myself.
I plan to write documentation of the program's design before coding it. This should help me make better choices ahead of time and I will be able to explore different implementations in Rust before deciding how to implement the design.

## Future Plans

Because I thought of implementing the game in Java, and because I want more experience with C++, I may translate the game to those languages as well for a fun exercise. If it proves too easy, I might program different card games in those languages afterwards.
