# Crazy Eights

## Introduction

While playing cards, I had the idea to program Crazy Eights because it seemed like a fun project. Initially, I wanted to write it in Java, but since I'm learning Rust I decided to challenge myself.
I plan to write documentation of the program's design before coding it. This should help me make better choices ahead of time and I will be able to explore different implementations in Rust before deciding how to implement the design.

## Future Plans

I will be testing the game's functions against the requirements and then I will write networking code to enable multiplayer functionality. I plan to introduce some documentation to detail what information will be sent over the network. If too many changes would be needed to make the game networked (i.e. client-server separation to prevent cheating, etc) then I will make a separate repository and try to finish the UI of this implementation first. That way, most of the game logic and UI will be complete before I try to deal with networking and anticheat logic.
